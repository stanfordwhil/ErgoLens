# Simple Javascript Websocket Client

A very simple html / javascript WebSocket client, that can be used to test my [Simple Websocket Server in Play!](https://github.com/ticofab/simple-play-websocket-server).

This client illustrates how to connect to a websocket endpoint, send & receive data, close the connection.

I wrote a presentation about WebSockets in Play!. Find it [here on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/FabioTiriticco/websocket-wiith-scala-and-play-framework).
